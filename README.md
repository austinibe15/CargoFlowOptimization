Container Stacking Optimization 

Overview
This script is designed to optimize the stacking of containers in a warehouse scenario where containers from different allotees need to be efficiently organized. The goal is to minimize reshuffling time during the offloading process, thereby increasing the efficiency of container handling operations.

Scenario Description
In this scenario, we are dealing with 100 containers expected to be delivered to a warehouse. Each container belongs to different allotees and is identified by its respective container number. The containers must be stacked in a dedicated stacking system that allows for easy access and minimizes the need for reshuffling during offloading.

Key Features
Expected AGV Travel Time Calculation: The script calculates the expected travel time for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) transporting containers from the quay to the stacking area. This is based on the distances between quay cranes and the stacking blocks, as well as the speed of the AGVs.

Expected Crane Handling Time Calculation: The script calculates the expected handling time for yard cranes that lift and stack the containers. This includes the time taken for lifting, reshuffling, and traveling to the respective stacking locations.

Optimization of Stacking: By analyzing the probabilities of which containers need to be accessed, the script aims to determine the optimal stacking strategy that reduces reshuffling time.

Output of Results: The script outputs the expected AGV travel time and crane handling time, providing insights into the efficiency of the stacking strategy.

How to Use
Setup: Ensure you have Python and the numpy library installed in your environment.

Input Data: Modify the example distances, probabilities, and constants in the script to reflect your specific scenario, including:

Distances from quay cranes to stacking blocks.
Probabilities of accessing different containers.
Average speeds of AGVs and cranes.
Handling times for lifting and reshuffling.
Run the Script: Execute the script in your Python environment to calculate the expected travel and handling times.

Analyze Output: Review the printed output to understand the expected AGV travel time and crane handling time. Use this information to adjust your stacking strategy as needed.

Example Calculation
Given that 100 containers are expected to be delivered, the script will help determine how many containers can be offloaded efficiently by analyzing the stacking arrangement. The optimization logic can be further enhanced by implementing specific algorithms to evaluate different stacking configurations based on the expected demand for each container.

Conclusion
By utilizing this script, warehouse operators can achieve a more efficient container handling process, ultimately reducing reshuffling time during offloading and improving overall operational efficiency. Adjust the parameters as necessary to fit your specific use case and maximize the benefits of optimized stacking.
